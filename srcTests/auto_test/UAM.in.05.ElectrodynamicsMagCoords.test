#DEBUG
0		debug level (0 = no info, 10 = max info)
0		cpu to watch
60.0		dt between normal code output to stdout
F		usebarriers - forces the code to stop and wait more often

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gitm can stop and start again:
  - Writes files to UA/restartOUT
  - Reads files from UA/restartIN
  - Can mv out and link to that directory

#RESTART
F		Restart Code

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
start and end times:
  - don't change start time on restart (code will set correct time!)

#TIMESTART

Set blocks in lon and lat. 
  - total cells in a direction = nBlocks x nCells (set in ModSize)
  - res = (max - min) / num cells

#GRID
2		number of blocks in longitude
2		number of blocks in latitude
-90.0		minimum latitude to model
90.0		maximum latitude to model
0.0		longitude start to model (set to 0.0 for whole Earth)
0.0             longitude end to model (set to 0.0 for whole Earth)

Output file stuff

#SAVEPLOTS

1		how many output files do you want

------------ Electrodynamics Drivers ------------

New auroral model from Wu and Ridley, which is driven by AU/AL/AE

----------- Data Files ------------------

This is the most common thing - specify an IMF file:
#MHD_INDICES
UA/DataIn/Examples/imf20021221.dat

#SME_INDICES
UA/DataIn/Examples/ae20021221.dat		SME Filename
none              			onset time delay file
T					convert SME to Hemispheric Power

#NGDC_INDICES
UA/DataIn/f107.txt

------------ Some options ------------

Low-latitude dynamo (only run with higher res). Turn on for higher res sims:
#DYNAMO
F		UseDynamo
45.0		DynamoHighLatBoundary
500		nItersMax
1.0		MaxResidual
F		IncludeCowling
40.0		LongitudinalAveraging
F               UseNewTrace

The default is to have apex off, since other planets don't have
apex, so need to turn apex on!

#APEX 
F     Apex is turned off for speed (so a dipole is used), but it can be turned on.
